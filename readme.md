# LinqKit Issue#14 Repro

This project is intended as a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example of [Issue #14](https://github.com/scottksmith95/LINQKit/issues/14) of the [LinqKit](https://github.com/scottksmith95/LINQKit) .Net package.

This project assumes you have a version of Sql Server you can connect to and create a database on.

I have tested it with localdb `Microsoft SQL Server 2014 (12.0.2000.8)`.

## Getting started
To get started, set your connection string in the `connectionString` variable at the top of the `Program.cs` file and hit `Start Debugging`.
